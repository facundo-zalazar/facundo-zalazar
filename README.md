- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Facundo Zalazar, welcome to my Github page.

	Here i will upload projects of different sources, to show you a preview of my works and knowledges. 
	
	From very early college projects with FPGAs, ARM Cortex processors to some challenges or personal projects. 
	
	Right now iÂ´m focused on that, write small projects in my free time.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new challenges, i really enjoy coding so i can switch easily from one language to another. 
	
	Love clean coding and flexibility to changes. 
	
	And remember: More coffee = More lines of code! â˜•

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python frameworks, Web pages testing (manual or automated), and React/Javascript coding.
